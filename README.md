# Mobile Development
Using the [Kotlin programming language](https://kotlinlang.org/) to develop applications. Using [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to handle all things related to data connection from android to the internet. Using [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) to fetch API, store user data and to authenticate login and register systems.

## Tech Stack
### Programming Language
- **Kotlin**: Leverage Kotlin's concise syntax and modern features to build a robust and maintainable codebase.

### Networking
- **Retrofit**: Handle all network communications between the Android client and the backend server.

### Cloud Services
- **Google Cloud**: Utilize Google Cloud for:
  - Fetching APIs for data interactions.
  - Storing user data securely.
  - Authenticating login and registration systems.

### Asynchronous Programming
- **Coroutines**: Handle asynchronous tasks efficiently and improve code readability.

## Project Structure
The project follows a modular MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.
